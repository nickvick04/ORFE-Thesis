Research is such a valuable thing to spend your time on at Cornell, not just for the benefits mentioned above but for the satisfaction of contributing to something greater than yourself! Find a professor in the ChemE department (or any department really) whose research interests you and email them saying:\\n\\nWho you are\\nWhy their research interests you\\nCan I come by your office to talk about it more\\n\\nThis is your best bet because if they do have positions open, you can have a face to face way of asking about it which puts your face in their head making your chances better. If they don't have any positions open, you'll still have made that connection by talking in person and they can point you to another faculty member that might have an open spot or might even better suit your interests!

       "30745  It might? It won't hurt at least. Cornell has a very very generous drop policy (drop without question up until October 18th, and a fairly easy petition for drop up until November 10th). For reference, your second prelim will typically be a week before November 10th, and finals are on December 10th.\\n\\nI'd sign up for the class if you're interested at all, and if you find that you can't/are not willing to handle the 15 hour a week homework assignments, drop it. I'd actually suggest that for most classes at Cornell.\\n\\nOne more thing. When I say 15 hour a week homework assignments, I mean it. I don't know what kind of math background you have, but in the past, I've always disregarded these kinds of warnings. Calc teacher said the class would take at least an hour a day (it didn't), Lin Alg professor at community college said the class would take 2 hours a day (it didn't), etc. Even at Cornell, I've found classes like CS 2800 and CS 3110 to take significantly less time than most people quote. It's only MATH 2230 that's lived up to the billed workload.\\n\\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to send me a PM or add me on Facebook or something like that. I had a lot of questions when I first got to Cornell, and some very helpful people really helped me get my orientation.   \n",

Go talk to some graduating seniors and you might get a different impression. \\n\\nIf you asked me why I'm here, it's because I love the things I'm learning and the amazing people around me. I do the things I do because they interest me or make me happy. You're not wrong that life isn't all about grades. Maybe try to go out and enjoy it a bit more if you can?   \n",

I don't think Cornell offers interviews for Engineering candidates, or at least ones that don't have much weight in admissions. Regarding being well rounded, my engineering ECs definitely have more depth and quality to them, the engineering ones I did to explore stuff, and have fun.\\n\\nI didn't know that the teams actually had interviews, as opposed to HS where you'd just sign up. It sounds really fun though.     \n",

The world is not a single nation and you wouldn't expect whites, for example, to make up 12% of all students in Asian universities since that's their proportion in the world population. If you legitimately think 60% of the population of Cornell should be Asian then you have 0 understanding of basic demographics and statistics.   \n",

His name is Jeremy. I honestly feel bad for him -- his parents are seriously depriving him of an environment where he can develop his social skills. Even just holding a conversation with him is genuinely difficult.    \n",

I was also admitted to the economic major for other top schools  (NYU, Vandy, Northwestern, etc) but I chose Cornell primarily for its hotel program.\\n\\nNot trying to defend other school's reputations coz that's not my job but...\\n\\nNYU Econ: Top 15 (i believe that is better than cornell's Econ; not rlly sure tho coz this was like my safety)\\n\\nVandy: #14 in country (tied with Cornell)\\n\\nNorthwestern: #11 (higher than Cornell)\\n\\nThese schools may not be necessarily better than Cornell, but it is certainly comparable to it.   \n",

Is the CASE harder or easier than the ap/is there a place where they post what to study for the exam?\\nThanks!   \n",

I am still curious though: Can you say from experience that people go from sub 3.0 GPAs to \\~3.5 by the time they graduate (since things get easier or for whatever reason)?     \n",

Honestly, it's not great. No service inside many buildings (I get service in buildings around the engineering quad, though!), and even outside it's a bit sketchy. By some stroke of luck I got a bit of service in my dorm room if my phone was within a few feet of the windows, but don't count on that because I've never gotten service in anyone else's dorm room. Downtown, though, the service is great, and you really can't beat VM's prices. It depends on how much you text and call, really. I rarely make calls and can make it through a lecture without needing to text. Plus Cornell has wi-fi virtually everywhere, so I often use Hangouts or the new Snapchat texting feature to communicate.\\n\\nTL;DR: Virgin Mobile service at Cornell is bad, but not bad enough to make me want to pay for Verizon. It depends on how phone-dependent you are.   \n",

Talk to [Athena Cole](https://www.facebook.com/Eraia) of the [Digital Gaming Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cornellgaming/). Cornell is funding us (uhh....it's an event where you grab connections. Yeah) so you have to pay stupidly little (like, $20? $30? I forgot) for transportation, a room (albeit shared with a *lot* of other people) and even the ticket.   \n",

To be honest, you're probably fine considering I never met my orientation leader because I was either not in my room at the time or I didn't hear his/her kncoking (or maybe he/she never came to pick me up) and I tagged along with other groups/people. I missed some of the events and they weren't checked off (there's a list online I believe), but with that being said I got no email/notification and I'm a Junior now. So, I think you're fine, but just email someone about it if it's an important event.    \n",

I didn't really like his lectures even though I did end up learning a lot. The labs for that class were really cool and made the class worth it in my opinion. Some of the homework was really difficult but he gave us a take home midterm and final so I think the median grade ending up being in the A range.\\nEDIT: Professor Lal also focuses a lot on MEMS which is kind of a MechE/ECE combination.   \n",
