Considering that the author claims that (s)he was on a team for 3 years, it's a rather telling omission.\\n\\n&amp;gt; And, in fact, this is the image project teams project, not just to the naive freshmen they prey on but also to the naive high schoolers applying to Cornell and the naive alumni donating to Cornell. Project teams are the darling of the College of Engineering because they lend it an additional sheen of selectivity and prestige.\\n\\nPeople should know that project teams aren't something unique to Cornell. Most engineering programs in the US have them, and it is to be expected for Cornell to also have them if it wants to be considered a top engineering program.\\n\\n&amp;gt; The premise of the interviews itself is a joke. What qualifies one student to interview another? Is it the extra two semesters of classes that does it? It is only with a huge helping of arrogance that it is possible to convince oneself of one’s qualification to judge a peer.\\n\\nWhat do you think will happen once you enter industry? You will get interviewed and evaluated for promotions/raises by more senior engineers. And part of being an upperclassman in a team will be learning how to assess applicants and leadership/management skills. \\n\\nConsidering that a project team aims to be a microcosm of a professional engineering organization, I only see this as a good thing. Underclassmen get practice on how to be interviewed, and upperclassmen get practice on how to interview.\\n\\n&amp;gt; How can we seriously cast project teams as some golden, educational force when they admit only a vanishingly small number of those interested?\\n\\nThe irony of saying this, while also being a student at one of the most selective universities in the country, must be lost on the author.\\n\\n&amp;gt; The glorification of stress culture has a home like no other in the project team. Working yourself to the bone, fueled by Mattin’s and Mountain Dew, is the norm. A badge of pride is having spent the night in the lab — and leaving early is a mark of weakness. Caught up in this competitive machismo, real intellectualism is lost and intellectual-signaling is what’s left.\\n\\nNone of this is unique to project teams, or even to the college of engineering as a whole. It's a cultural problem across the whole of Cornell, and pinning it on project teams is unreasonable.\\n\\nAnd as long as we're only going by anecdotal evidence: As an alum who was on a team from sophmore year to graduation, I can count on one hand the amount of times I've had to work past midnight, and none of those times were project-team related.\\n</td>\n",

Managed to not buy the textbook the whole year by (1) buying an older version for a few bucks (2) using the reserves at the library and (3) taking photographs of the problem sets off of my friends' books.\\n\\nI remember seeing a lot of other orgo review materials on DC++ though, just no Loudon :(   \n",

Usually you need the code but I'm sure you won't need one from now until classes start. \\n\\nYou can also park your car between rose and cook if you can't find a parking spot right next to the dorms. There's also parking on West Ave. and you can also park on Libe if there's little room elsewhere.    \n",

I had him for waves and again for quantum (3316, didn't take 3317 though). Now it sounds like he teaches 3323 as well!\\n\\nThat man is amazing. I feel like I really understood physics at a deep level when I had him for waves. Matthias \"Bullet Train\" Liepe was great whenever he substituted for Davis in waves, too. He just went really fast through the material, unfortunately. Not so great for freshman me but the whole course was just so mind-blowing. It's a pity that not all of the profs in the physics department are like that (looking at you, the profs who rotate on 2214).\\n\\nI also like Davis' stories/history anecdotes in his physics classes. Gives you a greater appreciation and broader context for the study of the field, even if you don't end up going into physics (I certainly didn't).   \n",

I am an engineering CS student who took 1110 first semester and got a B- and ended 1910 with a B. This semester I took 2110, got B- again and in 2800, I am about to get a C+, if lucky a B-. I did get a B+ in 1920, and because I did well in other classes, my GPA isn't too terrible, but the low grades in these CS classes are worrying.\\n\\nI am looking for advice as I am searching for opportunities to get involved with CS in the campus to build my resume, but my grades are too low to join any project team or clubs.    \n",
       "71018  I mean nearly all of these points are critiques the application process itself instead of the actual project team experience once you get in. Considering that the author claims that (s)he was on a team for 3 years, it's a rather telling omission.\\n\\n&gt; And, in fact, this is the image project teams project, not just to the naive freshmen they prey on but also to the naive high schoolers applying to Cornell and the naive alumni donating to Cornell. Project teams are the darling of the College of Engineering because they lend it an additional sheen of selectivity and prestige.\\n\\nPeople should know that project teams aren't something unique to Cornell. Most engineering programs in the US have them, and it is to be expected for Cornell to also have them if it wants to be considered a top engineering program.\\n\\n&gt; The premise of the interviews itself is a joke. What qualifies one student to interview another? Is it the extra two semesters of classes that does it? It is only with a huge helping of arrogance that it is possible to convince oneself of one’s qualification to judge a peer.\\n\\nWhat do you think will happen once you enter industry? You will get interviewed and evaluated for promotions/raises by more senior engineers. And part of being an upperclassman in a team will be learning how to assess applicants and leadership/management skills. \\n\\nConsidering that a project team aims to be a microcosm of a professional engineering organization, I only see this as a good thing. Underclassmen get practice on how to be interviewed, and upperclassmen get practice on how to interview.\\n\\n&gt; How can we seriously cast project teams as some golden, educational force when they admit only a vanishingly small number of those interested?\\n\\nThe irony of saying this, while also being a student at one of the most selective universities in the country, must be lost on the author.\\n\\n&gt; The glorification of stress culture has a home like no other in the project team. Working yourself to the bone, fueled by Mattin’s and Mountain Dew, is the norm. A badge of pride is having spent the night in the lab — and leaving early is a mark of weakness. Caught up in this competitive machismo, real intellectualism is lost and intellectual-signaling is what’s left.\\n\\nNone of this is unique to project teams, or even to the college of engineering as a whole. It's a cultural problem across the whole of Cornell, and pinning it on project teams is unreasonable.\\n\\nAnd as long as we're only going by anecdotal evidence: As an alum who was on a team from sophmore year to graduation, I can count on one hand the amount of times I've had to work past midnight, and none of those times were project-team related.\\n   \n",

Some coaches may see it as taking the initiative to contact before and showing you really want to play for them. However, I contacted the coach only after was accepted and decided to go to Cornell. I did this based on my other experience with Brown's coach telling me he was interested, but to reach out again only after I was accepted and made a decision to go there.   \n",

Just remember a few things.\\n\\n1. You're at Cornell. If the admissions committee didn't think you could succeed here, then they wouldn't have accepted you. You do belong here, even if it takes you a while to figure out how.\\n2. Other people's successes do not define your own ability to succeed. Nor are their successes any greater or more defining than your own.\\n3. You are not alone. There are plenty of students going through the same thinking you are, and there are plenty of people to talk to if you need someone to talk to about this feeling. \\n4. Failure is a part of growing. Learning from mistakes, identifying   your weaknesses, etc. are all important steps in maturing and bettering yourself for the future. Do not think of your failures as failures, but as a chance to improve yourself. Use them as a way to reach your next goal.   \n",

The buildings definitely are not as well-furnished and new as Mews/CKB, but the floor-suite layout allows for a much easier time socializing with the entire floor should one choose to. I had a *very* easy time Freshman year making friends with almost my entire floor in High Rise 5 (around 40 people), and most of us still see each other regularly after a few years apart.\\n\\nObviously your experience will vary depending entirely on the mix of people you get, but going into Freshman year you will generally find that everyone wants to make as many friends as possible as quickly as possible, and the cozy social dynamic only helps with that!   \n",

I can't recommend strongly enough that you will want to use on-campus housing for the first year you are there. Yes, its more expensive and not as nice as off campus options - but you will form a social network that you will have for the next few years (if not the rest of your life).  Get to know your neighbors!\\n\\nAt Cornell, I found that you are most likely to be friends with people who live geographically close to you. A 20 minute walk might not seem like much, but on-campus it might as well be an eternity..    \n",

Is this advisable? Should I just send them the SATs? Also, can I use score choice on the subject tests? Does this make any sense?\\nThanks for your time!\\n\\nWhile I'm at it, I'm currently planning on either doing comp sci, economics, or both. Does my choice of subject tests put me at a disadvantage if I apply for comp sci? I understand comp sci has little to do with history but the same can't be said for CAS right? Or should I apply for economics instead as my SAT IIs better suit economics? Either way I'm applying to CAS. Thanks again.   \n",

However, much like everything in life it's ultimately up to you on how you judge things. You can think of Greek Life as a bunch of privileged  and vain young adults or see it as a group of people who want a platform to meet tons of new people and share awesome experiences with them.   \n",

Have fun making friends and getting to know people on your own time, and don't make yourself unhappy your first week. People will still be outgoing after o-week, you have plenty of time to make friends- classes, dormmates, clubs, etc. Hell, I didn't go out at all O-Week, and I'm perfectly happy. Remember, this is your first semester of college- nobody's judging you, do what you enjoy! (Seriously, \"be yourself\" is such cliche advice but it's easier to make good friends if you're genuine).\\n\\nAlso, if you're looking for less draining activities- there's plenty around! The observatory and the botanical gardens are interesting and quieter. Furthermore, this is a great time to explore campus- it's a big place and during the rush of the semester you won't have much time to wander. Find the good study spots and places to eat now.\\n   \n",

Lol Yale and Harvard care a lot more about GPA than LSAT for sure. Stanford, they want a more well-rounded student, but they also want a 3.8+ GPA and weigh less on LSAT. Your bro has credentials for UVA, Duke, Gtown, Berkeley, Cornell...might be a few more. \\n\\nBtw fuck the prestigious Ivy League branding; it doesn’t mean shit. I meet so many capable people from non Ivies. If you are certain about law school and staying in your state like NY, you can go to Fordham and still graduate with employment prospects. Emory is a great law school. Atlanta is a great city to practice in, but he can also find jobs outside of GA. Might be harder, but if he’s top 10-20% of his class, he’ll do well. \\n\\nIf you want a 4.0, go to another school. You’re going to be assessed the same way anyway. You sound so fixated on GPA, and while that’s important, the end goal is to get a fucking job out of law school, right? You have to consider location, potential law schools to get into, where you want to be after you graduate, etc. You haven’t even gotten into college yet. For sure, T14 will bolster your bicoastal job prospects. You can still get a job/clerkship at whatever state you want to practice in. You need solid life experiences and reassess your life values and goals before really determining if law is the path for you. College changes how you perceive the world. \\n\\nIdk the numbers of law school placements, but from what I can tell, they do. Know lots of people at T14. Know lots of people at top state law schools like Fordham and USC too. But, what they do afterwards, we have to see.    \n",

If there are 850 students in the class and everyone's phone is connected to the Wi-Fi and even only a third of students are using their laptops, that's over 1000 connected devices for that one rooms infrastructure to handle and most of the time, it's load isn't nearly that high.\\n\\nCan't do much about it, so if you can avoid using the internet for that lecture period or use mobile data on your phone, that's kinda the only option (afaik).   \n",

I’m also in that class too now (which makes me wonder if we talked before our class is so small).  I really think you should consider what you love about biological engineering and why it’s your passion.  If it’s not, maybe consider another major? I know for me that thinking about grades gives me stress to do well, but always reminding myself why I like studying a certain topic makes me like the major again. \\n\\nThe class is really shit though yeah but I feel like the only thing we can do is tough it out (which sucks) or complain to March.    \n",
