-44: outlines measures of linguistic complexity by type, clarifies difference between human readers and NLP
-44: the most relevant lexical measures seem to be rich vocabulary, long words, infrequent terms, abstract concepts (semantic?), figurative language (semantic?)
-44: the most relevant syntactic measures seem to be sentence length, syntax complexity, passive voice, negative constructions

-325: word token is an instance of a particular word type, in other words the number of tokens is frequency of type (i.e., a word)
-325: defines TTR as TTR(N)=V(N)/N, a measure of the number of unique tokens (words) relative to length of text (i.e., vocabulary size)

Vickery Reflections
-Might want to use either Zipf curve tails or age of acquisition, as there is likely overlap
-Might want to use either parse tree depth or ICS, as there is likely overlap
-Determine whether substantive quality is feasibly quantified
-Test my quantification system against qualitative rankings of text quality

-Need to figure out how to strip emojis from text for lexical analysis
-Do I want to require the first letter be capital in a complete sentence?
-Should I only compute parse tree depth for complete sentences?

-Could use readability scale to determine run ons


-Look into Automatic Essay Scorers (AES)
-Look into Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)
-Incorporate absolute vs. relative complexity distinction, 31
-Look to Marco et al. for processing, 8
-Look to Evelyn M for processing


Decisions:
-TweetTokenizer
-Comma heuristic in subordinator logic for is_complete_sentence, edge cases

-There are broadly 4 categories of syntactic complexity
-Length of production: MLC (num words/num clauses), MLS (num words/num sentences), MLT (num words/num T-units)
-Sentence complexity: clauses per sentence
-Subordination: C/T (clauses/num T-units), CT/T (num complex T-units/num T units), DC/C, DC/T
-Coordination: CP/C (coordinate phrases per clause), CP/T, T/S
-Particular Structures: CN/C (num complex nominals / num clauses), CN/T, VP/T

-Count incomplete sentences as sentence fragments, use in metrics (see pg 44)
